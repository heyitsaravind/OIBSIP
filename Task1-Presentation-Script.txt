TASK 1: ATM INTERFACE SYSTEM - DEMONSTRATION SCRIPT
================================================================================
Duration: 3-5 minutes

INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello everyone! I'm Aravind M S, and today I'll be demonstrating Task 1 from my 
Oasis Infobyte Java Development Internship - the ATM Interface System.

This is a console-based banking application that simulates real ATM operations 
with secure authentication and transaction management. The system is built using 
core Java and follows Object-Oriented Programming principles.

Let me show you how it works.


SECTION 1: PROJECT OVERVIEW (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ATM Interface System provides five main features:

1. Transaction History - View all your past transactions
2. Withdraw - Take money out of your account
3. Deposit - Add money to your account
4. Transfer - Send money to another account
5. Quit - Safely logout from the system

The application uses three Java classes:
- ATMInterface.java - The main program with user interface
- BankAccount.java - Manages account data and operations
- TransactionRecord.java - Tracks all transactions with timestamps


SECTION 2: RUNNING THE APPLICATION (15 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[SHOW TERMINAL]

To run the application, I'll use these commands:
First, compile all Java files: javac Task1-Enhanced-ATM/*.java
Then run the program: java -cp Task1-Enhanced-ATM ATMInterface

[EXECUTE THE COMMANDS]


SECTION 3: LOGIN DEMONSTRATION (45 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[SHOW WELCOME SCREEN]

As you can see, the system displays a professional welcome banner and 
authentication menu.

Let me first view the sample credentials by selecting option 2.

[SELECT OPTION 2]

The system provides three demo accounts for testing. I'll login using 
Account Number: 12345 and PIN: 1234

[SELECT OPTION 1, ENTER CREDENTIALS]

Great! Login successful. The system welcomes me by name - "Welcome, Aravind Kumar"
and displays the main menu with all five features.


SECTION 4: FEATURE DEMONSTRATIONS (2 minutes)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURE 1: TRANSACTION HISTORY
[SELECT OPTION 1]

The transaction history shows all activities with:
- Date and time stamps
- Transaction type
- Amount involved
- Detailed description

Currently, we can see the login activity. Let's perform some transactions 
to see how this updates.


FEATURE 2: DEPOSIT
[SELECT OPTION 3]

Let me deposit Rs. 5,000 into the account.
[ENTER 5000]

Perfect! The system confirms:
- Amount deposited: Rs. 5,000
- Updated balance: Rs. 20,000 (was 15,000)
- Transaction timestamp

Notice the balance increased from 15,000 to 20,000.


FEATURE 3: WITHDRAW
[SELECT OPTION 2]

Now let me withdraw Rs. 2,000.
[ENTER 2000]

Excellent! The withdrawal is successful:
- Amount withdrawn: Rs. 2,000
- Remaining balance: Rs. 18,000
- Transaction completed with timestamp

The system also has built-in validations:
- Cannot withdraw more than available balance
- Maximum withdrawal limit of Rs. 50,000 per transaction


FEATURE 4: TRANSFER
[SELECT OPTION 4]

Let me transfer Rs. 3,000 to another account.
I'll transfer to account number 67890, which belongs to Priya Sharma.

[ENTER 67890]

The system displays the recipient's name for verification.

[ENTER 3000]

Transfer successful! The system shows:
- Amount transferred: Rs. 3,000
- Recipient name: Priya Sharma
- Updated balance: Rs. 15,000

This feature includes security checks:
- Verifies recipient account exists
- Cannot transfer to same account
- Maximum transfer limit of Rs. 25,000


VIEWING UPDATED TRANSACTION HISTORY
[SELECT OPTION 1]

Now let's check the transaction history again.

As you can see, all our transactions are recorded:
1. Login activity
2. Deposit of Rs. 5,000
3. Withdrawal of Rs. 2,000
4. Transfer of Rs. 3,000 to Priya Sharma

Each transaction has complete details with timestamps.


FEATURE 5: QUIT
[SELECT OPTION 5]

Finally, let me logout using the Quit option.

The system displays a thank you message and safely terminates the session.
All transaction data is preserved in the account object.


SECTION 5: CODE ARCHITECTURE (45 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[OPTIONALLY SHOW CODE IN EDITOR]

Let me briefly explain the code structure:

The BankAccount class handles:
- Account information (number, PIN, holder name, balance)
- Transaction list management
- Deposit and withdrawal operations

The TransactionRecord class stores:
- Transaction type and amount
- Description and timestamp
- Formatted date/time display

The ATMInterface class provides:
- User authentication
- Menu-driven interface
- Input validation and error handling
- All five feature implementations


SECTION 6: KEY FEATURES & VALIDATIONS (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system includes several important validations:

1. Secure PIN-based authentication
2. Amount validation (must be positive numbers)
3. Balance checking before withdrawals
4. Transaction limits for security
5. Account verification for transfers
6. Complete transaction logging
7. Professional error messages


CONCLUSION (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To summarize, this ATM Interface System demonstrates:

✓ Core Java programming skills
✓ Object-Oriented Programming principles
✓ User input handling and validation
✓ Data structure usage (HashMap, ArrayList)
✓ Professional console interface design
✓ Real-world banking logic implementation

The complete source code is available on my GitHub repository at:

Thank you for watching this demonstration! This project has helped me strengthen 
my Java development skills and understand real-world application design.

TIPS FOR RECORDING:
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Show your face or use screen recording with voiceover
- Pause briefly between sections
- Keep terminal text size large and readable
- Test all features before recording
- Have the script open on another screen for reference
- Record in a quiet environment
- You can skip the code architecture section if time is limited
