TASK 2: ONLINE EXAMINATION SYSTEM - DEMONSTRATION SCRIPT
================================================================================
Duration: 3-5 minutes
Presenter: Aravind M S
Project: OIBSIP Java Development Internship
================================================================================

INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello everyone! I'm Aravind M S, and today I'll be demonstrating Task 2 from my 
Oasis Infobyte Java Development Internship - the Online Examination System.

This is a console-based examination platform that simulates real online exams 
with MCQ questions, timer functionality, and automatic submission. The system 
is built using core Java and follows Object-Oriented Programming principles.

Let me show you how it works.


SECTION 1: PROJECT OVERVIEW (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Online Examination System provides five main features:

1. Login - Secure user authentication
2. Update Profile and Password - Manage user information
3. Selecting answers for MCQs - Answer multiple choice questions
4. Timer and auto submit - 5-minute countdown with automatic submission
5. Closing session and Logout - Safe session termination

The application uses four Java classes:
- ExamSystem.java - The main program with user interface
- UserProfile.java - Manages user account data
- ExamSession.java - Tracks exam progress and answers
- Question.java - Stores MCQ questions and options


SECTION 2: RUNNING THE APPLICATION (15 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[SHOW TERMINAL]

To run the application, I'll use these commands:
First, compile all Java files: javac Task2-Online-Examination/*.java
Then run the program: java -cp Task2-Online-Examination ExamSystem

[EXECUTE THE COMMANDS]


SECTION 3: LOGIN DEMONSTRATION (45 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[SHOW WELCOME SCREEN]

As you can see, the system displays a professional welcome banner and 
authentication menu.

Let me first view the sample credentials by selecting option 2.

[SELECT OPTION 2]

The system provides two demo accounts for testing. I'll login using 
Username: student1 and Password: pass123

[SELECT OPTION 1, ENTER CREDENTIALS]

Great! Login successful. The system welcomes me by name - "Welcome, Aravind Kumar"
and displays the main menu with three options.


SECTION 4: FEATURE DEMONSTRATIONS (2 minutes 30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURE 1: UPDATE PROFILE AND PASSWORD
[SELECT OPTION 1]

The system provides a submenu for profile management:
1. Update Full Name
2. Update Email
3. Change Password

Let me update my email address.
[SELECT OPTION 2]

Current email is displayed. I'll enter a new email.
[ENTER: aravind.new@email.com]

Perfect! Email updated successfully. The system confirms the change.

Now let me demonstrate password change.
[SELECT OPTION 3]

The system asks for:
- Current password for verification
- New password (minimum 6 characters)
- Confirmation of new password

[ENTER CURRENT PASSWORD: pass123]
[ENTER NEW PASSWORD: newpass123]
[CONFIRM PASSWORD: newpass123]

Excellent! Password changed successfully. The system reminds me to use 
the new password for next login.

[RETURN TO MAIN MENU]


FEATURE 2: START EXAMINATION
[SELECT OPTION 2]

The system displays exam information:
- Subject: Java Programming Fundamentals
- Total Questions: 5
- Time Limit: 5 minutes
- Each question carries 1 mark

[CONFIRM: yes]

The examination begins!


FEATURE 3: SELECTING ANSWERS FOR MCQs
[EXAM IN PROGRESS]

Notice the timer at the top showing remaining time in minutes and seconds.

Question 1 appears with four options.
"What is the size of int data type in Java?"
1. 16 bits
2. 32 bits
3. 64 bits
4. 8 bits

I'll select option 2 (32 bits) - the correct answer.
[ENTER: 2]

Question 2: "Which keyword is used to inherit a class in Java?"
1. implements
2. extends
3. inherits
4. super

I'll select option 2 (extends).
[ENTER: 2]

Question 3: "What is the default value of boolean variable in Java?"
1. true
2. false
3. null
4. 0

I'll select option 2 (false).
[ENTER: 2]

Question 4: "Which method is the entry point of a Java program?"
1. start()
2. main()
3. run()
4. execute()

I'll select option 2 (main()).
[ENTER: 2]

Question 5: "What is the parent class of all classes in Java?"
1. System
2. String
3. Object
4. Class

I'll select option 3 (Object).
[ENTER: 3]


FEATURE 4: TIMER AND AUTO SUBMIT
[AFTER ANSWERING ALL QUESTIONS]

The exam is automatically submitted after all questions are answered.
If the timer runs out before completion, the system will auto-submit 
whatever answers have been recorded.

The timer continuously displays remaining time for each question, 
creating a realistic exam environment.


EXAM RESULTS AND ANSWER KEY
[RESULTS SCREEN]

The system displays:
- Total Questions: 5
- Questions Attempted: 5
- Correct Answers: 5
- Score: 5/5

Then it shows the ANSWER KEY section:

For each question, it displays:
- The question text
- Your answer with [CORRECT] or [INCORRECT] status
- If incorrect, it shows the correct answer

This helps students learn from their mistakes immediately.

Example:
Question 1: What is the size of int data type in Java?
Your Answer: 2. 32 bits [CORRECT]

Question 2: Which keyword is used to inherit a class in Java?
Your Answer: 2. extends [CORRECT]

And so on for all questions.


FEATURE 5: CLOSING SESSION AND LOGOUT
[SELECT OPTION 3 FROM MAIN MENU]

The system displays a logout message:
"Logging out..."
"Thank you for using our examination system, Aravind Kumar!"

Session terminated successfully with a professional goodbye message.

The system safely closes the session and returns to the login screen.


SECTION 5: CODE ARCHITECTURE (45 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[OPTIONALLY SHOW CODE IN EDITOR]

Let me briefly explain the code structure:

The UserProfile class handles:
- User credentials (username, password)
- Personal information (name, email)
- Profile update methods

The ExamSession class manages:
- Exam timing (start and end time)
- Answer recording
- Score calculation
- Attempted question tracking

The Question class stores:
- Question text
- Four options
- Correct answer number

The ExamSystem class provides:
- User authentication
- Menu-driven interface
- Timer implementation
- Exam flow control
- Result display with answer key


SECTION 6: KEY FEATURES & VALIDATIONS (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system includes several important validations:

1. Secure username/password authentication
2. Email format validation (must contain @)
3. Password strength check (minimum 6 characters)
4. Password confirmation matching
5. Timer countdown with millisecond precision
6. Automatic submission on timeout
7. Answer validation (1-4 only)
8. Complete answer key with explanations


CONCLUSION (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To summarize, this Online Examination System demonstrates:

✓ Core Java programming skills
✓ Object-Oriented Programming principles
✓ Timer and thread management
✓ User input handling and validation
